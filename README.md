## 🛠️ **Features**
1. **Dataset Generation**:
   - A Python script (`generate_dataset.py`) generates a mock dataset simulating engagement metrics (e.g., likes, shares, comments, post types).

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Utilizes **DataStax Astra DB** for storing and querying the dataset.

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Leverages **Langflow** to:
     - Query average engagement metrics by post type (Carousel, Reels, Static Images).
     - Generate insights using GPT integration.

4. **Interactive Website**:
   - A user-friendly interface to visualize engagement metrics and insights.

5. **Modular Versions**:
   - **Version 01**: Basic functionality.
   - **Version 02**: Enhanced features and improved analysis.
